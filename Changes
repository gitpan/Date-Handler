	- Added additionnal test cases for standard month, and intuitive months calculations. 

0.15 Mars 13 2002

          data member to be empty and preventing concatenation.
	(Thanks to Ron Savage <ron@savage.net.au> for the spot)

	- Fixed problems with locale and the new() constructor
	(Thanks to Ron Savage <ron@savage.net.au> for the spot)
		. Locale() is now only used to get the current locale for an object,
